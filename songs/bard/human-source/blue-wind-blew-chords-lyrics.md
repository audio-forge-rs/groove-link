           Bb
Well the blue winds blown my dreams away
    Eb
My darling's flown and she's gone to stay.
Bb
All I got now is yesterday
                          F
And I don't know what to do.
 
         Bb
Well I guess I'll go downtown and see
       Eb
Just what downtown can do for me
  Bb
Maybe set my lonesome free
                 F
Or maybe let me go.
 
I loved her true and I told her so
I ask her too and she told me no.
She said she had somwhere to go
and in the end she said: Goodbye
 
Well I wonder how long it can go on
How long I'll sing this same old song
I wonder which one done us wrong
Which one forgot to try.
I loved her true and I told her so
I ask her too and she told me no.
She said she had somewhere to go
and in the end she said: goodbye.

I love you true and I told you so
I ask her too and she told me: no
She says she had somewhere to go
And in the end she said: goodbye.
