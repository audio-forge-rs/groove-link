# Morning Light - A jazz-influenced trio with ambient pad
#
# This example demonstrates groove-link capabilities:
#   - Tempo and song metadata
#   - Instrument tracks with presets and production FX
#   - Note FX (humanization, note delay)
#   - Audio FX chains with preset effects
#   - Shared FX via Audio Receiver routing
#   - Mastering chain on master track
#   - ABC notation parts auto-converted to MIDI
#
# Usage:
#   bitwig project create examples/morning-light.yaml
#   bitwig project create examples/morning-light.yaml --track piano

  room:
    receives:
      - piano: pre             # Pre-fader: reverb independent of volume
      - bass: pre
      - drums: pre
      - pad: pre
    fx:
      - Room One               # Natural room ambience
      - EQ-5                   # Roll off low frequencies from reverb

  # Parallel compression bus for drums
  drum_crush:
    receives:
      - drums: post            # Post-fader: follows drum volume
    fx:
      - Compressor             # Heavy compression
      - Saturator              # Add harmonics

  # Master bus - final polish
