# Morning Light - A jazz-influenced piano trio
#
# This example demonstrates groove-link capabilities:
#   - Tempo and song metadata
#   - Instrument tracks with presets
#   - Note FX (humanization, arpeggio)
#   - Audio FX chains
#   - Shared FX via Audio Receiver routing
#   - ABC notation parts auto-converted to MIDI
#
# Usage:
#   bitwig track create examples/morning-light.yaml
#   bitwig track create examples/morning-light.yaml --track piano

  # Lead piano with humanization for natural feel
  piano:

    note_fx:
      - Humanize x 3           # Subtle timing/velocity variation

  drums:
    instrument: Drum Machine

  # Shared room reverb - receives from all instruments
  # Creates cohesive space without per-track reverb
  room:
    receives:
      - piano: pre             # Pre-fader: reverb independent of volume
      - bass: pre
      - drums: pre
    fx:
      - Room One               # Natural room ambience
      - EQ-5                   # Roll off low frequencies from reverb

  # Parallel compression bus for drums
  drum_crush:
    receives:
      - drums: post            # Post-fader: follows drum volume
    fx:
      - Compressor             # Heavy compression
      - Saturator              # Add harmonics
